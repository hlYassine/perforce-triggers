# Welcome to GitHub docs contributing guide
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to `perforce-triggers` project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [ATHORS](https://github.com/hlYassine/perforce-triggers/blob/main/AUTHORS).


In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](https://github.com/hlYassine/perforce-triggers/blob/main/README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)


## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through [existing issues](https://github.com/hlYassine/perforce-triggers/issues) to find one that interests you. 

### Make changes locally

- Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
- Fork the repository
- `cd` to project folder.
- Run `poetry install` to install project dependencies and create `python` virtual environment.
- Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Pull request (PR)

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request.

- Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, it will be reviewed. I may ask questions or request for additional information.
- I may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations and thank you for your contribution.

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the project repository.
